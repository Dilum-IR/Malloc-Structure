# Malloc & Free -Structures
<h3>This Repo include the malloc free <</user define functions/>> , mymalloc heder file and Example include main function. MyMalloc &amp; MyFree. >>>> Virtual memory allocation to used Array Structure. Initialization, Memory split, Allocated memory's -> Free and Free memory's -> merge 
<h3/>
<br><h4>
This algorithm to use array and singly linked-list data structures.
For all memory alloction to create new meta block.
That block include  allocation memory Size, Free or not free that split memory and next allocation memory meta block address sotre the next struct pointer variabel.it's haven't next memory block then next is NULL.
